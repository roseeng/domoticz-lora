# domoticz-lora
Extending the range of a Domoticz installation using cheap lora nodes

First setup will be two TTGO Lora32 units, one connected to the raspberry that runs Domoticz, one at the beach, controlling the bridge lights.
I think I will try to make a Domoticz plugin that uses serial to communicate between Domoticz and the base TTGO node.
